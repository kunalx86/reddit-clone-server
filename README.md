# Express Typescript Basic Template App

This is a very basic REST API template for Express framework using Typescript for Nodejs
\
This itself is based on `npx express-typescript-generator`\
However, front-end related stuff has been removed.
Also database configuration is not present

## Env files
.env files are not uploaded as it is instead you should rename `src/pre-start/env/*.env.example` files to just `*.env` in the same folder
